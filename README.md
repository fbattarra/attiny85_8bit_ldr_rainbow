## Bill Of Materials:
* 1x Digispark mounting an Attiny85
* 1x 8xWS2812B rigid led bar
* 1x LDR ("5528" used in the project)
* 1x 10KÎ© resistor

## Tested Working Development Environment:
* IDE : PlatformIO (v2.1.0, on Visual Studio Code v1.35.0)
* OS: MacOS 10.13.6 (Hig Sierra)


## Libraries/Dependencies:
* [RunningMedian](https://platformio.org/lib/show/1361/RunningMedian)
* [Adafruit NeoPixel](https://platformio.org/lib/show/28/Adafruit%20NeoPixel)


## Nice To Know:
* To upload the code, make sure to have an USB cable with every pin wired: cheap charging cables often have just +5V and ground wired
* Uploading from PlatformIO to DigiSpark needs you to plug the DigiSpark __after__ compiling, even though the console doesn't warn "now it's time to plug your DigiSpark", as Arduino IDE does.
* Quick fix for issue in uploading to DigiSpark from PlatformIO on MacOS: [PIO issue 111](https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelavr/issues/111)
* Cheap USB chargers may provide dirty/noisy output, which could make LEDs oddly flicker expecially at low brightness: make sure to have a clean 5VDC source, or to filter adding a capacitor or a more proper circuit like this one:
